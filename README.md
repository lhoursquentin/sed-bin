# sed-bin: Compile a sed script

This project allows to translate **sed** to **C** to be able to compile the
result and generate a binary that will have the exact same behavior as the
original sed script, for example `echo foo | sed s/foo/bar/` will be replaced
by `echo foo | ./sed-bin`.

# Quick start

## Setup
Clone the repo and move inside its directory, you'll need the usual UNIX
core and build utils (sed, libc, C compiler, shell, make).

*Note: this project is currently tested with the GNU libc (2.31), GNU sed (4.5)
and GCC (10.1.1) on Fedora 32. Some additional tests have been done on FreeBSD 12.1*

## How to use

### Quick step-by-step

Let's take a simple example:
```bash
sh$ echo foo | sed s/foo/bar/
bar
```
Assuming you want to compile `s/foo/bar/`:

- Use the provided [compile](./compile) shell script, this takes care of the C
  translation and compilation steps:
```bash
sh$ echo s/foo/bar/ | ./compile
+ cat
+ ./par.sed
+ make
cc    -c -o sed-bin.o sed-bin.c
cc    -c -o address.o address.c
cc    -c -o operations.o operations.c
cc    -c -o read.o read.c
cc   sed-bin.o address.o operations.o read.o   -o sed-bin
Compiled sed script available: ./sed-bin
```

- Once the generated C code is compiled, you can use the resulting `sed-bin`
  binary in place of `sed s/foo/bar/`:
```bash
sh$ echo foo | ./sed-bin
bar
```

That's about it!

### Full walk-through with a bigger script

Say you want to compile the following sed script which is used to generate the
table of contents of this project's README (can also be found in the [samples
directory](./samples)):

```sed
#!/bin/sed -f

# Generate table of contents with links for markdown files
# Usage: sed -f <this-script> <mardown file>

# ignore code blocks
/^```/,/^```/d

# no need to index ourselves
/^# Table of contents/d

# found heading
/^#/{
  # save our line and first work on the actual URI
  h
  # strip leading blanks
  s/^#*[[:blank:]]*//
  s/[[:blank:]]/-/g
  # punctuation and anything funky gets lost
  s/[^-[:alnum:]]//g
  # swap with hold and work on the displayed title
  x
  # get rid of last leading # and potential white spaces
  s/^\(#\)*#[[:blank:]]*/\1/
  # the remaining leading # (if any) will be used for indentation
  s/#/  /g
  # prepare the first half of the markdown
  s/\( *\)\(.*\)/\1* [\2](#/
  # append the link kept and remove the newline
  G
  s/\(.*\)[[:space:]]\(.*\)/\1\2)/p
}
d
```

Let's use the provided translator [par.sed](./par.sed) which is a big sed
script translating other sed scripts to C code. Redirect the output to a file
named `generated.c`. Another file with some declarations called
`generated-init.c` will be created by the translator automatically. You'll need
those two files to generate a working binary.

```sh
sh$ sed -f par.sed < samples/generate-table-of-contents.sed > generated.c
```

If you take a peek at `generated.c`, you'll note that for simplicity and
readability the generated code is mostly functions calls, the actual C code
doing the work is not generated but mostly found in
[operations.c](./operations.c). Now we're ready to compile the generated code:

```sh
sh$ make
cc    -c -o sed-bin.o sed-bin.c
cc    -c -o address.o address.c
cc    -c -o operations.o operations.c
cc    -c -o read.o read.c
cc   sed-bin.o address.o operations.o read.o   -o sed-bin
```

A binary named `sed-bin` has been generated, it should have the exact same
behavior as the sed script:

```sh
sh$ ./sed-bin < README.md

# Sample scripts

Some example sed scripts are available in the [samples](./samples) directory:

- [samples/binary-add.sed](./samples/binary-add.sed)
- [samples/generate-table-of-contents.sed](./samples/generate-table-of-contents.sed)
- [samples/tic-tac-toe.sed](./samples/tic-tac-toe.sed)
- [par.sed (sed to C translator)](./par.sed)

Other notable sed scripts tested with this project:

- [sokoban.sed](https://github.com/aureliojargas/sokoban.sed), a
  [sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) game written by Aurelio
  Jargas
- [dc.sed](http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc.sed), an arbitrary
  precision reverse polish notation calculator written by Greg Ubben
- [chainlint.sed](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/t/chainlint.sed), a git
  internal tool to detect broken "&&" chains in shell scripts.

# How it works

## Some generated code
The translator [par.sed](./par.sed) (which is written in sed itself) converts
sed commands calls to valid C code:

```bash
sh$ echo y/o/u/ | sed -f ./par.sed
```

Will output:

```c
y(&status, "o", "u");
```

The actual logic to handle `y` (and most other commands) is not generated, we
just need to translate the sed syntax to valid C code, which here stays fairly
readable.

Let's look at a slightly more complex example:

```sed
/foo/{
  p;x
}
```

Translates to:
```c
static Regex reg_1 = {.compiled = false, .str = "foo"};
if (addr_r(&status, &reg_1))
{

p(&status);
x(&status);

}
```

And an example of how labels are handled:

```sed
b end

# some comment
i \
Doesn't look like this\
code is reachable

: end
```

Translates to:
```c
goto end_label;


// some comment
i("Doesn't look like this\ncode is reachable");

end_label:;
```

# Why

Not much practical use to this, here are some thoughts:

- Debugging a sed script is hard, one possible way is to run `sed` in gdb,
  but this assumes some familiarity with the implementation. Here the generated
  C code is rather close to the original sed script, which should allow gdb to
  be easier to use (`make -B CFLAGS=-g` for symbols).
- Might be useful for obfuscation or maybe to limit the scope of sed? Resulting
  binaries are usually smaller than a full `sed` binary as well.
- Better speed? Since the generated code is specific to a script, one might
  expect it to be much faster than using `sed`, since we can skip parsing,
  walking the AST etc. I didn't do any serious measurements yet, but so far it
  seems slightly faster than GNU sed (around 20% faster to translate the
  translator for instance).

# Translating the translator

The basic idea of this project is to translate **sed** code to **C** code, to
compile it and have a resulting binary with the same behavior as the original
script.

Now, since the translator from sed to C is written in sed, we should be able to
translate the translator, compile it, and then be able to use the compiled
version to translate other sed scripts.

Translate the translator (`par.sed`) with itself:

```sh
sh$ ./par.sed < ./par.sed > generated.c
```

```sh
sh$ make
cc    -c -o sed-bin.o sed-bin.c
cc    -c -o address.o address.c
cc    -c -o operations.o operations.c
cc    -c -o read.o read.c
cc   sed-bin.o address.o operations.o read.o   -o sed-bin
```

We now have a binary that should be able to translate sed code, let's try to
translate the translator with it:

```sh
sh$ ./sed-bin < ./par.sed | diff -s generated.c -
Files generated.c and - are identical
```

Generated code is identical, which means that at this point we have a
standalone binary that is able to translate other sed scripts to C. We no
longer need another sed implementation as a starting point to make the
translation.

# Using this project as a sed alternative

A shell script named [sed](./sed) is available in this repository, providing
the same interface as a POSIX sed implementation.

```sh
sh$ echo foo | ./sed s/foo/bar/
bar
```

Here `./sed` automates argument parsing, translation, compilation and execution
of the resulting binary. On one hand this is much heavier than the usual sed
implementation, but on the other hand it provides an easy way to quickly test
and compare this project with other implementations.

The default translation is done with the `./par.sed` translator script, which
will use the default **sed** binary available on the system. So that means we
need to use a full **sed** implementation to provide another **sed**
implementation which doesn't make much sense. To get rid of this initial
**sed** dependency simply translate and compile `par.sed`, save the generated
binary and then use the **sed** shell script with `SED_TRANSLATOR` environment
variable set to the newly created binary.

For example:

```sh
sh$ BIN=compiled-translator ./compile ./par.sed
+ cat ./par.sed
+ ./par.sed
+ make
cc    -c -o address.o address.c
cc    -c -o operations.o operations.c
cc    -c -o read.o read.c
cc    -c -o sed-bin.o sed-bin.c
cc address.o operations.o read.o sed-bin.o -o compiled-translator
Compiled sed script available: compiled-translator
sh$ echo foo | SED_TRANSLATOR=./compiled-translator ./sed 's/foo/bar/'
bar
```

# Notes

- Incomplete features / known issues:
  - with 2 addresses, the `c` command will be executed every time for each
  matching line instead of only once when leaving the range
  - no pattern/hold space overflow checks, currently both limited to 8192 bytes
  as per the minimum POSIX spec requirement. Going over that limit will most
  likely cause a segfault.

- The translator does not handle invalid sed scripts, it will just generate
  invalid C code (and potentially loop endlessly) which will probably fail to
  compile, make sure you can run your script with an actual `sed` implementation
  before attempting to translate it.

- Non POSIX support is currently not planned, if you are using GNU sed, you can
  try to see what is not supported by running your script with the `--posix`
  option. Also check out the [POSIX specification](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html).

- Only `-n` (suppress the default output) is accepted as a command line
  argument of the resulting binary.

- The generated binaries currently only accept data from stdin:
  `./sed-bin < file` not `./sed-bin file`. If you have multiple files use
  `cat file1 file2 file3 | ./sed-bin`.

- The C code is very rough around the edges (by that I mean dirty and unsafe,
  for instance allocating everything on the stack without checking any
  overflow), I'm still working on it, but contributions (issues/comments/pull
  requests) are also welcomed :)
